      LIBRARY: FING - NIST Fingerprint Systems Utilities

      FILE:           BZ_DRVRS.C
      ALGORITHM:      Allan S. Bozorth (FBI)
      MODIFICATIONS:  Michael D. Garris (NIST)
                      Stan Janet (NIST)
      DATE:           09/21/2004

      Contains driver routines responsible for kicking off matches
      using the Bozorth3 fingerprint matching algorithm.

***********************************************************************

      ROUTINES:
#cat: bozorth_probe_init -   creates the pairwise minutia comparison
#cat:                        table for the probe fingerprint
#cat: bozorth_gallery_init - creates the pairwise minutia comparison
#cat:                        table for the gallery fingerprint
#cat: bozorth_to_gallery -   supports the matching scenario where the
#cat:                        same probe fingerprint is matches repeatedly
#cat:                        to multiple gallery fingerprints as in
#cat:                        identification mode
#cat: bozorth_main -         supports the matching scenario where a
#cat:                        single probe fingerprint is to be matched
#cat:                        to a single gallery fingerprint as in
#cat:                        verificaiton mode
