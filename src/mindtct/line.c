      Contains routines that compute contiguous linear trajectories
      between two coordinate points required by the NIST Latent
      Fingerprint System (LFS).

#cat: line_points - Returns the contiguous coordinates of a line connecting
#cat:               2 specified points.

   Input:
      x1      - x-coord of first point
      y1      - y-coord of first point
      x2      - x-coord of second point
      y2      - y-coord of second point
   Output:
      ox_list - x-coords along line trajectory
      oy_list - y-coords along line trajectory
      onum    - number of points along line trajectory
   Return Code:
      Zero      - successful completion
      Negative  - system error
